S.O.N.I.A C++ Style Guide
=========================

Preface
-------

C ++ is the main language in the S.O.N.I.A AUV platform.
The platform has been developed and maintained for many years by different members of the software team.
This involves that programming styles may differ from project to project.
With the recent desire to contribute to open-source movement, a standardization and an uniformity of style should be established.

The purpose of this guide is to document procedures and best practice recommended at S.O.N.I.A.
This document is not intended as a barrier to development, but as tool to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Like C ++, this document evolves over time. Members are therefore invited to participate in the development of this document as well as its update.
